# Policies

## Overview
The `Policies` directory contains all the policy documents that are essential for managing and enforcing firewall policies within IntelWall. This directory is structured to provide easy access and organization of policy-related files.

## Structure
- `protocols/`: Contains scripts and documents related to network protocols. This includes capturing and analyzing network traffic to ensure compliance with policy rules.
- `ip/`: Contains policies related to IP address management and access control.
- `ports/`: Contains policies related to port management and access control.
- `applications/`: Contains policies related to application control and access management.

## Python Libraries
The following Python libraries are used to create and manage policies:
- **pyshark**: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **subprocess**: For running system commands.
- **json**: For handling JSON data.
- **and many more to be decided**: We are continuously evaluating and integrating new libraries to enhance our policy management capabilities.
